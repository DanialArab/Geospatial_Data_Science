GeoJSON:

GeoJSON is a format for encoding geospatial data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. It is designed to be a lightweight, simple, and easy-to-use format for representing and exchanging geospatial data on the web. GeoJSON can represent a variety of spatial features, including points, lines, polygons, and multi-geometries, as well as properties associated with those features.
