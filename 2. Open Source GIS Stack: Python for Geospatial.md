## 2. Open Source GIS Stack: Python for Geospatial

Source: **Learning the Open Source GIS Stack: Python for Geospatial** course by Arthur Lembo - udemy cource

We learn about the **FOSS4G** (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) stack. The course has 4 parts:
+ Loading software and data
+ Python packages
+  Geospatial additions to Python

Software installation:

+ **QGIS (Quantum GIS)** is a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software that allows users to view, edit, and analyze geospatial data. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, visualizing, and publishing geospatial information. QGIS can be used for a variety of tasks, such as creating and editing maps, analyzing and manipulating data, and publishing maps and data on the web. QGIS is compatible with a wide range of data formats, including shapefiles, GeoTIFF, KML, and PostGIS. It also supports a range of geospatial operations, such as geocoding, geoprocessing, and spatial analysis. QGIS is a popular choice among researchers, GIS professionals, and other users who need to work with geospatial data.
