## 2. Open Source GIS Stack: Python for Geospatial

Source: **Learning the Open Source GIS Stack: Python for Geospatial** course by Arthur Lembo - udemy cource

We learn about the **FOSS4G** (Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial) stack. The course has 3 parts (excluding the Python review part):
+ Loading software and data
+ Python packages
+  Geospatial additions to Python

Software installation:

+ **QGIS (Quantum GIS)** is a free and open-source GIS software that allows users to view, edit, and analyze geospatial data. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for creating, visualizing, and publishing geospatial information. QGIS can be used for a variety of tasks, such as creating and editing maps, analyzing and manipulating data, and publishing maps and data on the web. QGIS is compatible with a wide range of data formats, including shapefiles, GeoTIFF, KML, and PostGIS. It also supports a range of geospatial operations, such as geocoding, geoprocessing, and spatial analysis. QGIS is a popular choice among researchers, GIS professionals, and other users who need to work with geospatial data.

+ **PostgreSQL**

As  a database management system (DBMS), we use PostgreSQL. 

PostgreSQL and MySQL have many similarities, but they also have some differences in terms of features, performance, and the way they handle certain tasks. For example, PostgreSQL has more advanced features for handling complex data types, concurrency control, and transactions, while MySQL is known for its performance and ease of use.
