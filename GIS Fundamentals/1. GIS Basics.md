### GIS Glossary of Terms

The following is a glossary of GIS terms. 

GIS General

0. Vector vs. Raster: 

Vector Data: Vector data represents geographic features as **discrete points, lines, and polygons.** It uses coordinates (x, y or latitude, longitude) to define the vertices of these features. Vector data is well-suited for representing precise geometric shapes and is commonly used for discrete object-based analysis and editing.

Raster Data: Raster data represents geographic information as a **grid of cells or pixels**, where each cell holds a value representing an attribute or measurement. It covers the entire extent of the grid and is typically used to represent continuous phenomena like elevation or satellite imagery. Raster data enables analysis using cell-based operations and is often used for **continuous analysis and modeling**.

In summary, vector data represents features as points, lines, and polygons with discrete coordinates, while raster data represents information as a grid of cells with continuous values. Both data models have different strengths and are used for different analysis and visualization purposes in GIS.

Vector and raster are two fundamental data models used in GIS to represent and analyze geospatial information. Here's a comparison between vector and raster data:

+ Data Representation:

Vector: Vector data represents geographic features as discrete points, lines, and polygons. Points represent individual locations, lines represent linear features like roads or rivers, and polygons represent enclosed areas like land parcels or administrative boundaries.

Raster: Raster data represents geographic information as a grid of cells or pixels, where each cell holds a value representing an attribute or measurement. Raster data is continuous and covers the entire extent of the grid.

+ Data Structure:

Vector: Vector data is composed of coordinates (x, y or latitude, longitude) that define the vertices of points, lines, and polygons. It can also include attribute tables that store additional information about each feature.

Raster: Raster data is organized into a regular grid of cells, where each cell represents a unit of space and contains a value. The grid is usually defined by a pixel size, and the value in each cell represents a specific attribute or measurement.

+ Geometric Accuracy:

Vector: Vector data can represent precise and accurate geometric shapes. It is well-suited for representing features with distinct boundaries, such as buildings or property boundaries.

Raster: Raster data represents data as cells, so it may not capture fine geometric details accurately. It is more suitable for representing continuous phenomena, such as elevation or temperature, over large areas.

+ Data Size and Complexity:

Vector: Vector data tends to have smaller file sizes compared to raster data, especially for complex features with few vertices. It is more efficient when representing sparse or discrete features.

Raster: Raster data can have larger file sizes, especially when representing high-resolution or large-area datasets. The file size depends on the pixel resolution and the number of attributes or bands stored.

+ Analysis Capabilities:

Vector: Vector data is suitable for precise spatial analysis and operations like overlay, buffering, network analysis, and topology checks. It is commonly used for discrete object-based analysis and editing.

Raster: Raster data enables analysis using cell-based operations like interpolation, overlay, and terrain analysis. It is often used for continuous analysis and modeling, such as calculating slope, vegetation indices, or suitability analysis.
Both vector and raster data have their strengths and are used for different types of analysis and visualization in GIS. The choice between vector and raster data depends on the nature of the data, the analysis requirements, and the specific application or research question at hand.

1.	Spatial Data – data with a geographic location, representation, or reference point that it describes.

2.	Cartography – the science of map making, including data inclusion, layout, elements, colors, and design. As much as it’s a science, it’s an art form.

3.	Shapefile – an Esri proprietary data format for storing geographic data. Very cross-GIS compatible, but limiting in many aspects. Often misused to mean any geographic dataset as in “could you send me that shapefile?”

A shapefile is a common geospatial **vector data format** used in GIS (Geographic Information System) software. It is a file format developed by Esri, but it has become widely supported by various GIS software applications.

Shapefiles consist of multiple files that collectively store geographic data. The main components of a shapefile include:

+ .shp: This file stores the actual geometry of the geographic features, such as points, lines, or polygons. It contains information about the coordinates and attributes of the features.

+ .shx: This file is an index file that helps in quickly accessing the geometric data stored in the .shp file.

+ .dbf: This file is a dBASE database file that contains attribute data associated with the geographic features. It stores information in tabular format, with each row representing a feature and each column representing an attribute.

In addition to these main files, a shapefile can also have additional optional files such as .prj (projection file) that defines the coordinate system, .sbn and .sbx (spatial index files), and .shp.xml (metadata file).

Shapefiles are versatile and can represent different types of geographic features, **such as points (e.g., cities, landmarks), lines (e.g., roads, rivers), and polygons (e.g., boundaries, land parcels)**. They are commonly used for storing and exchanging geospatial data because of their simplicity, wide software support, and compatibility across different platforms.

GIS software, including Esri's ArcGIS, QGIS, and many others, can read, write, and analyze shapefiles. They provide tools for visualizing, editing, querying, and analyzing the spatial and attribute data contained within shapefiles.

It's important to note that shapefiles have some limitations, such as not supporting advanced geometric types (e.g., 3D or curved geometries) and having a file size limit of 2 GB. However, shapefiles continue to be widely used due to their simplicity and compatibility with various GIS software applications.

4.	Layer – multiple meanings in a GIS context:

    a.	The distinct data elements that compose a map document, ordered one on top of the next for GIS drawing order (top is drawn last and seen first)

    b.	A single data element, saved into a GIS file format along with its associated symbology.

5.	Scale – the ratio of the size of elements on screen or in print on the map to their size in the real world

6.	Raster – spatial data that stores location based upon a single origin point and a data stream of known width, height, and resolution. Often used for continuous surfaces.

a.	DEM – Digital Elevation Model. A specific use case of raster data where the pixel value represents the elevation of areas covered by the pixel. Sometime called a DTM (digital terrain model) or DED (digital elevation dataset).

7.	Vector – spatial data that stores location using Cartesian coordinate locations.

    a.	Point – A single spot in (usually) two dimensional space. Attributes represent only that location (and sometimes are inferred to represent nearby locations).

    b.	Line (Polyline) – Multiple points connected to represent all locations in between along the connection.

    c.	Polygon – Multiple polylines connected to create a boundary. Polygon zones are generalized representations where all locations contained within the boundaries are considered to have the same property.

8.	Coordinate System/Spatial Reference – defines the origin point, coordinate space, and geoid for a dataset’s spatial data

    a.	Datum – the origin point of the coordinate system and information required to accurately define an origin, like a surface model

    b.	Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) – A coordinate system that specifies latitude and longitude as coordinates

    c.	Projected Coordinate System – similar to and includes a GCS. “Projects”/transforms coordinates into a new coordinates system to display a map in 2D space. Sometimes referred to as “the projection” of a dataset.

9.	Resolution – the density of data of a raster dataset or rasterized map document. Sometimes used to mean the density of data in any dataset. For raster datasets, this value is expressed as the length of the side of a pixel (eg: 10m pixels). For rasterized graphic formats, it is most commonly expressed in pixels per inch of paper (ppi) or dots per inch of paper (dpi) and a good target to reach is 300 dpi for clear prints.

10.	Geoprocessing – the practice of using GIS tools to process, transform, filter, and query GIS data.

11.	Python – a programming language with capabilities for GIS analysis. Useful for automating tasks in GIS.

12.	Join – The use of a common attribute to link data tables in order to access the attributes of one along with the other or assign the attributes of one to the other based upon a key value. When this is the record ID of the other dataset, it’s often a foreign key. Eg:  summary statistics tables built for HUC12s, stored in separate datasets can be linked back to the HUC12 by the HUC12 ID.

13.	Spatial Join – Similar to a Join in that it transfers attributes, but the linkage used to connect the datasets is the location of each item. I find this to be the “hammer” of GIS.

14.	Symbology – the representation of a particular dataset in a map document.

15.	Tables – a data structure with a defined set of fields, and many rows representing individual data records.

    a.	Fields (columns) – a variable represented in a data table. Instances of this field can be looked up per record to find the value

    b.	Rows – individual data records

    c.	Primary Key – an identifier attribute, usually assigned automatically by the database management engine, that provides a unique integer value by which to reference a data record.

16.	Environment Variables (Environments) – variables/settings that affect the run of a geoprocessing tool. In other computer systems, variables that affect how programs are found and run.

17.	Basemap – a prerendered set of mapping data that can be placed below the data of interest to quickly create a map with context. Frequently, a basemap is served up over the Internet by a basemap server and loaded on the fly by your GIS.

ArcGIS Specific
1.	ArcMap – the interface for geographic data analysis, querying, layout, and export.

2.	ArcCatalog – the interface for geographic data management.

3.	ArcToolbox – a suite of tools, available from both ArcMap and ArcCatalog, for analyzing, transforming, and querying geographic data.

4.	Map Document – much like a Word document, a map document stores information about a particular map and its layout. It does not store the geographic data or import it and so a map document file cannot be sent in the same way as other documents

5.	MXD (See Map Document) – File extension for map documents. Often used as a synonym for it (eg: “do you have the MXDs?”)

6.	Data View – the interface used to view and query data in ArcGIS.

7.	Layout View – the interface used to design and lay out a map for export - all nongeographic elements such as title, data sources, scale bar, etc.

    a.	Data Frame – the container for layers in layout or data view, but also the viewport for data on the page in layout view.

8.	Feature Class – data stored in an ESRI geodatabase. A feature class is a collection of features with the same geometry type, projection, and fields. Can be commonly thought of as a dataset.

9.	Personal Geodatabase – A type of geodatabase that uses Microsoft Access 2003 format databases as the container, allowing it to be used as a database within Access and for spatial data. A super handy tool to have in your back pocket if you understand relational databases.

10.	File Geodatabase – An Esri proprietary database format. Data stored within it is obfuscated and can only be accessed reliably from Esri software. Faster and more efficient than other storage methods and able to store huge datasets and large amounts of data overall.

11.	Default Geodatabase – The default location that ArcMap will use to save geoprocessing and export products. It saves you from always having to define locations for data. It is defined for each map document and can be changed upon loading the document, in map document properties, or in environment setttings.

12.	Spatial Analyst – An extension to ArcGIS that adds significant raster processing functionality. Many of the tools are useful for a watershed GIS workflow.

13.	Table of Contents – the set of layers in ArcGIS. Provides access to layer properties and tools.

Remote Sensing
1.	Orthophoto – an aerial photo whose pixels are location corrected for the differential distortion created by the lens and elevation of land.

Watershed Analysis
2.	Watershed – The entire land area contributing to the water flow at an outlet or stream junction.

3.	Contributing Watershed – a watershed based upon an arbitrary point of interest (a dam, etc)

4.	Blue Lines – a cartography term for streams.

5.	NHD – National Hydrography Dataset – A dataset that contains water bodies and streamlines for the United States.

a.	Flowlines – the streamlines contained within NHD

6.	WBD – Watershed Boundary Dataset – a dataset containing nested watershed boundaries for the United States

7.	NHDPlus – an enhanced version of NHD that adds additional attributes for each streamline, such as contributing area, flow, elevation, WBD, etc. Often used in place of NHD.

8.	HUCs – Hydrologic Unit Codes – the watersheds created by the WBD. Usually designated by their size with the digit length (2,4,6,8,10,12) indicating the scale with 12 being the most specific and refined. HUC8s in CA are likely familiar, and HUC12 are useful for refined scale mapping.

Other
1.	Color Ramp – the scale of colors used to symbolize a range of values in a map

More terms:

1. Parcel

In GIS (Geographic Information System) terminology, a parcel refers to a specific type of geographic feature representing a **single unit of land ownership or a bounded area of land**. **Parcels are typically associated with cadastral data, which is information about land ownership, boundaries, and property rights.**

Parcels are commonly used to represent individual land parcels or lots within a larger geographic area, such as a city, county, or municipality. They can represent residential, commercial, or industrial properties and are often used for property assessment, taxation, land use planning, and real estate purposes.

In a GIS, parcel data may include attributes such as the owner's name, property address, land use classification, assessed value, and other relevant information. Parcels are often represented as polygon features with boundaries defined by their legal or physical boundaries, and they can be stored and managed in a geodatabase or other spatial data formats.

Parcels are valuable components of GIS data because they provide a detailed representation of land ownership and can be used to analyze and visualize land-related information. For example, parcel data can be used to assess the spatial distribution of property values, identify zoning violations, determine land use patterns, and support decision-making processes related to urban planning and development.

It's worth noting that the term "parcel" can have slightly different meanings or variations depending on the specific context or jurisdiction. The exact definition and attributes associated with parcels may vary between different GIS datasets or regions.

2. Buffer analysis

Buffer analysis is a geospatial operation in GIS that **creates a polygon or a set of polygons around a given feature, based on a specified distance or buffer zone**. The buffer is typically represented as a concentric area around the feature, extending outward from its boundaries.

The purpose of buffer analysis is to evaluate spatial relationships and assess the impact or influence of a feature within a certain distance. It is commonly used for various spatial analysis tasks, such as:

+ Proximity Analysis: Buffer analysis helps identify features that fall within a specific distance of interest. For example, determining all buildings within a certain distance of a riverbank or identifying areas within a specific radius of a point of interest.

+ Spatial Query: Buffering can be used to select features that interact or intersect with a defined zone. For instance, selecting all roads within a buffer zone around a proposed development site.

+ Planning and Zoning: Buffer analysis is useful in urban planning to define zoning regulations or land use restrictions within a certain distance from sensitive areas like schools, parks, or environmentally protected zones.

+ Impact Assessment: Buffering enables the assessment of potential impacts from natural or human-made hazards. For example, evaluating the areas affected by a flood by creating buffers around rivers based on historical flood extents.

+ Visual Representation: Buffer polygons can be used to symbolize or visually represent areas of influence or importance in maps and visualizations.

In buffer analysis, the buffer distance or zone can be defined in various units such as meters, kilometers, feet, miles, or any other relevant spatial reference system units.

By applying buffer analysis, GIS users gain insights into the spatial relationships, proximity, and impact of features, enabling informed decision-making, planning, and analysis in various fields, including environmental management, urban planning, transportation, and emergency response.
